<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> The project philosophy is centered around developing a mobile app that integrates OpenAI technology to enhance the financial well-being of users.
>
> This app aims to make it simple and convenient for individuals to manage their finances, empowering them to make informed decisions with the assistance of AI-based financial advisors. Ultimately, the goal is to help users achieve better financial outcomes without sacrificing the convenience and ease of use they have come to expect from modern mobile applications.

### User Stories

-   As a user, I want to be able to sign up with my own credentials, so that I can create a personalized account on the platform and access its features.
-   As a user, I want to be able to login with my own credentials, so that I can easily access the platform and utilize its features.
-   As a user, I want to be able to create multiple wallets, so that I can segregate my business finances from my personal finances, and have better control over my finances.
-   As a user, I want the option to select an AI-powered financial advisor to help me make informed financial decisions, so that my overall financial health improves.
-   As a user, I want to be able to specify my recurring expenses and incomes, so that I don't have to manually input them every time they occur.
-   As a user, I want to be able to categorize each expense or income record that I insert into the system, so that I can have a better understanding of my financial transactions and make more informed financial decisions.

The AI advisor should take all my financial data as input, including my chosen AI advisor for the AI to impersonate, and output an optimal decision on whether the expense is a good or bad financial decision. This will help me to make informed financial decisions and avoid overspending or making poor financial choices.
-   As a user, I want to be able to track my incomes and expenses by date, so that I can have a clear picture of my financial transactions on any given day.

-   As an admin, I want to be able to update user information, so that I can assist users in case they need help with updating their account details or resolving any account issues.
-   As an admin, I want to be able to assign admin privileges to other users, so that I can delegate administrative tasks and ensure a smooth operation of the platform.

> We designed Wallii using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
